* jQuery Mobile.  
* HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3.
* [Apache's Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) for converting the HTML5, JS, and CSS into Android executable app.

Backend
-------------
* nginx - Our primary webserver, acts as a reverse proxy with gunicorn, directly serves our static and media files. ([See our nginx files](webserver/nginx)).
* gunicorn - Python WSGI app server for Django.
* Django framework - For creating an API for this app that the frontend can consume.
* PostgreSQL - our backend DB that is linked to Django.
* Python 3.4 with `virtualenv` to ensure that we can box and ship the backend with ease should we wish to do so.
