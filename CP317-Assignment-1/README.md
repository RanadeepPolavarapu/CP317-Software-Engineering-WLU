WLU CP 317 Assignment #1 - JavaScript Goblin Game

#####By: Ranadeep Polavarapu, Bruno Salapic, Lee Glendenning, Ryan Burke

Checklist
=========
Requirements
------
*  [✔] Prevent the sprites from going out of the screen.  
*  [✔] The player can move the hero by clicking and dragging using the mouse  
*  [✔] The canvas' width and height should be half of those of the browser's window.  
*  [✔] The background image should cover the whole canvas.  
*  [✔] Every 3 seconds, a new goblin appears in a random position and moves at a random speed;  
when it hits the edge of the screen, it bounces back in the opposite direction. The goblin should
move in any random direction, such as up, down, left, right, and, say, 45% diagonally.  
*  [✔] When the hero catches a goblin the number of goblins caught should be updated. The caught
goblin should disappear.  
*  [✔] Use localStorage to store the number of goblins caught. This number should persist and be
displayed across launches of the game.  
*  [✔] Add background sound. When the hero catches a goblin, a distinct sound should be played.  

Bonus
------
*  [✖] Touching a point P on the screen triggers a bullet firing from the center of the hero to the direction of P, provided P is not in the hero’s icon. You should programmatically destroy the bullet when it hits the screen edge, for otherwise keeping track of a large number of bullets will slow down your game and possibly crash it. A goblin is caught when it is hit by a bullet.
